# Black-Sholes-Binomial-Tree

Solve the following problems using the Black-Scholes formula and the binomial tree model.

1. A stock is trading at $250 with a volatility of 0.4. The risk free rate is 4%. Find the price of a European call option on the stock with 2 years to maturity and a strike price of $260. The stock does not pay dividends.

2. A stock is trading at $250 with a volatility of 0.4. The risk free rate is 4%. The stock does not pay dividends. Create a 2-step tree for the stock with a time step of 6 months.
-Find the price of a derivative (cash-or-nothing option) that pays $500 if the stock is below $270 in one year, and nothing otherwise.

3. Use the same 2-step tree as in Q2.
Find the price of a derivative that pays (Max(K-ST,0))**(1/2) at expiration in 1 year. Use K = $260.
